            <p>
                Hello! My name is Ruben, a graduate student at Rutgers University-New Brunswick and a first-generation Latino.
                My parents immigrated from Peru with little education, seeking a better future. Despite challenges, we achieved 
                success thanks to the supportive community I grew up in. Inspired by this, I am committed to giving back and 
                making a difference. Initially pursuing chemistry with plans for medical school, I discovered my passion for 
                engineering during a summer job at a nephrology office. While there, I consulted with the physician's husband, 
                a chemical engineer, who encouraged me to pursue chemical engineering as an alternative to chemistry, aligning 
                with my passion for creating and lifelong learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                This decision transformed my academic journey. Although I faced significant challenges in undergraduate studies,
                I was exposed to fascinating industries that solidified my interest in pharmaceuticals rather than medicine.
                To deepen my expertise, I joined research groups to expand my knowledge and prepare for the industry.
                This led me to enroll in my school's 4+1 program, allowing me to pursue both a bachelor's and master's degree. 
                Now a senior, I am excited to graduate and contribute to advancing pharmaceutical innovation.

                        <h3>Advanced Control of Continuous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Pilot Plant</h3>
                    <div class="projects-item-caption">
                        <p>Over the summer I was able to venture out into the world of pharmaceutical manufacturing.
                            I worked closely with both undergraduate engineers and graduate students
                            to design a proof-of-concept continuous manufacturing system. This project
                            demonstrated the potential of advanced control to improve the efficiency
                            and safety of the manufacturing process. This was a great experience for my
                            professional development as a researcher and a team leader. I was able to
                            apply my engineering skills and problem-solving abilities to a real-world.
                            I mainly focused on carrying out experiments with unit operations such as
                            diaphram pumps, ultrafiltration unit, and a vial filling system. This research poster
                            only focused on one section of the overall project being conducted. Thus, if more
                            information about my work is wanted, feel free to reach out.
